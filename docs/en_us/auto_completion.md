The server auto complete found `Server Scripts File Widget` (you can disable that in server configuration).

For the server to detect them, you must put tags. 

Exemple with a HTML file

```html
<p>Port : @{{ server.port }}</p>
```

In the browser, it will be shown for exemple

```txt
Port : 3000
```
